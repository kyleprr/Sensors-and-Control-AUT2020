# Group 4 Project Video

This README document should accompany the video submitted along with 
the code for group 4's project for the subject 41014 Sensors and 
Control for Mechatronic Systems.


## Description

The video demonstrates the process used to run the project successfully.
It starts with showing each command to run in the correct order and then
demonstrates the user controlling the Leader Turtlebot and driving it around the 
environment while the Following Turtlebot follows behind without user input by detecting 
the Aruco Tag on the Leader. In the video two views are shown, one is the image view being seen 
from the Followers perspective and the Gazebo simulation view showing the whole environment 
from a birds eye perspective.


This video can be used alongside group 4's submitted code and its README document to help 
install and run the project successfully on the readers local machine.
